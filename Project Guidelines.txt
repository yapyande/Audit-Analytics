1. Compare Price vs. Rent — The Price-to-Rent Ratio by district
Goal: Understand which districts are more favorable for buying vs. renting.

How:

Compute price_to_rent_ratio = average_sale_price / (annual_rent * 12) by district or property type.

Visualize it on a map.

Identify “overvalued” (high ratio) or “undervalued” (low ratio) areas.
Visualize it on a map.

Identify “overvalued” (high ratio) or “undervalued” (low ratio) areas.

Insights:

High ratios → better to rent; Low ratios → better to buy.
This mirrors how real estate investors assess local markets.

2. Investment Yield Analysis

Goal: Estimate rental yield — the percentage return you’d get from renting out a property.

How:

rental yield
=
annual rent
purchase price
×
100
rental yield=
purchase price
annual rent
	​

×100

Compare yields across districts or property sizes.

Correlate yield with property features (size, location, age).

Extension: Adjust for taxes, maintenance, or average vacancy rate if you have those variables.

6. Clustering Neighborhoods

Goal: Group similar districts by their housing and rental characteristics.

How:

Combine features like average price, rent, size, and amenities.

Use K-means or hierarchical clustering.

Label clusters (e.g., “Affordable”, “Luxury”, “Mid-tier”, “High-rent, low-price”).

This can help reveal hidden structure in your city’s housing market.


Using the existing dataset, create a model that will predict the price of the resale flat using existing variables (use one-hot encoding)

Using the model, find the more significant variables that determines the resale flat price

Using a new model, are we able to determine if there is a relationship between flat price and rental price

Could we use sentiment analysis?

What are the conclusions?

How are we able to improve the model? E.g. Rental flats data a little lacking compared to resale flats. What other possible variables may be useful to determine the prices (distance to amenities, public transport)?
